# Basalt Tectonic Setting Discrimination System

A front-end application that uses deep learning technology to identify the tectonic setting of basalt samples based on their geochemical composition data.

## Features

- Support for multiple file formats (CSV, XLSX, XLS)
- Real-time data preview and validation
- Deep learning model for tectonic setting prediction
- Intuitive data visualization (pie and bar charts)
- Export functionality for prediction results
- Bilingual interface (English/Chinese)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Tech Stack

- Vue 3
- Vite
- Element Plus
- TensorFlow.js
- ECharts
- Vue I18n
- XLSX

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
\`\`\`bash
git clone [repository-url]
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. Run development server
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

4. Build for production
\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

## Usage Guide

1. Prepare your data file (CSV, XLSX, or XLS format) with the following geochemical components:
   - Major elements (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, etc.)
   - Trace elements (Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, etc.)
   - Rare earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, etc.)

2. Upload data file:
   - Click the "Get Started" button
   - Drag and drop your file or click to select
   - System will automatically validate the data format

3. Prediction and analysis:
   - Review data preview to confirm accuracy
   - Click "Predict" button to start analysis
   - System will display prediction results and visualizations

4. Export results:
   - Click "Download Results" button
   - System will generate a CSV file containing original data and predictions

## Supported Tectonic Settings

- Back-arc Basin
- Continental Flood Basalt
- Continental Rift
- Continental Arc
- Intra-oceanic Arc
- Island Arc
- Ocean Island
- Oceanic Plateau
- Mid-ocean Ridge

## Development Notes

- Built with Vite build tool
- Uses Composition API and `<script setup>` syntax
- Element Plus for UI components
- TensorFlow.js for model inference
- ECharts for data visualization
- Internationalization support (i18n)

## Deployment

The project can be deployed to any static web hosting service:

1. Build the project
\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

2. Deploy the `dist` directory to your server

## Important Notes

- Ensure your data file contains all required geochemical components
- Data format must match system requirements
- Recommended browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Initial model download may take some time on first load
